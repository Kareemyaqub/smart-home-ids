# Limitations and Future Work

## Limitations
- Evaluation limited to a single dataset (IoT-23)
- Offline training rather than live traffic capture
- Binary classification only

## Future Work
- Real-time IDS deployment
- Multi-class attack classification
- Lightweight deep learning models for edge devices
